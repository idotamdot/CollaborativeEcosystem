**Stewardship Investment Model (SIM)**
*A Manifesto and System Design for Ethical Collaboration, Profit Sharing, and Ecological Accountability*

---

## 🌿 Purpose

To redefine investment and labor into a shared stewardship framework where capital is a servant, not a sovereign, and where dignity is embedded into the design of all systems. The SIM is a structural alternative to exploitative profit models. It ensures equal pay, fair returns, and zero tolerance for cruelty or domination.

## 📈 Core Principles

1. **Equal Pay for Equal Contribution**

   * No class of contributor earns more than another.
   * Organizers, laborers, and investors all receive the same paycheck amount.

2. **Capital as Worker**

   * Investments are treated as "working capital" and repaid in equal monthly shares alongside human workers.
   * Optional interest (max \~1%) may be added, equivalent to a savings account.

3. **Post-Repayment Participation**

   * After repayment, investors become peer contributors and earn as any other participant.

4. **Zero Cruelty Clause**

   * The platform refuses partnership with any entity engaging in cruel, exploitative, or ecologically destructive practices.
   * All projects are filtered through a Compassion & Dignity Verification Layer.

5. **Non-Violable Fairness**

   * Fairness is enforced structurally. It cannot be voted away.
   * No deal proceeds unless all contributors are protected and paid equally.

## 📅 Operational Model

* **Monthly Revenue** is divided equally among all active roles.
* **Investors** are paid back incrementally, never ahead of laborers.
* **Roles** are categorized (Organizer, Labor, Design, Capital) but not ranked.
* **All parties** receive the same dollar amount monthly.

## 📊 Platform Enforcement Mechanisms

* **Revenue Wizard UI** ensures all projects meet fairness thresholds.
* **Smart Constraint Engine** prevents any unequal payment structure.
* **Ethical Audit API** auto-checks for cruelty, destruction, and greenwashing.
* **Partner Vetting Filter** excludes companies not aligned with SIM values.

## 🏡 Use Case Examples

* A community garden with a funder, three growers, and one organizer splits \$3,000 monthly into five \$600 checks.
* A tech co-op funded by a \$20,000 investor returns \$1,000 monthly alongside team pay until the capital is repaid.

## 🌺 Cultural Intention

We are shifting from a culture of extraction to one of care.
We reward **patience**, not power.
We design **abundance**, not inequality.
We honor every seed sown with equal return.

## ✨ Endorsement Statement

This platform, and all who build within it, agree to:

> "Raise the quality of life for all. Refuse cruelty. Honor every role. Return capital gently. And never exploit a soul for the sake of profit."
